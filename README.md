# URN

URN stands for "Underactuated Robotics Notes". This directory hosts my supplementary code used for my [notes](https://markhsaad.github.io/post/bp13_urn1/) on Russ Tedrake's course on [underactuated robotics](http://underactuated.mit.edu/index.html). While I intend to write good, clean code, the main focus of this code is to help me understand the content of the course, so it may not be the most user-friendly code out there. But I hope it can be of some use to someone out there.
